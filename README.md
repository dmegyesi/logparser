logparser
=========

Yet another (DHCP) router log parser

TODO:
-----
- [ ] ResultStore: sort by last modification date, ascending -> generate all of the diffs file by file
- [ ] support for finding the last processed file & work with all the rest
- [ ] support for debug mode
- [ ] writing to exec logfile
- [ ] logrotate function

- [ ] investigate: 'ls -t' vs. current implemented find + epoch time sort
